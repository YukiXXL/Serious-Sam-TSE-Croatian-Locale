Our destination, the Tower of Babel, is very near now.  The Portal that we are looking for should be placed there but beware, there is an old legend about a monster living inside.  The legend says that whoever defeats it will be granted with a journey to the afterlife. It seems that the monster is there to protect the portal.

But for now, we'll have to find our way out of here. We are currently in the palace of King Tilmun and the only way out is through that door in front.
